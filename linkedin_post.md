🏆 Thrilled to announce our achievement at MIT x Mozilla Firefox - Kurukshetra National Hackathon 2025!

After an intense 36-hour coding marathon (24-hour hackathon + 12 hours prep), our team emerged victorious among 700+ participants across India in the Agentic AI domain.

🚀 Introducing Singularity: The Next Evolution in Enterprise Knowledge Management

We built a cutting-edge MultiModal Agentic AI system that's pushing the boundaries of how organizations can interact with their data. Here's what makes it special:

🧠 Advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) System:
• Processes ANY file type (video, audio, images, PDFs)
• Converts content into searchable vector embeddings
• Enables semantic search across entire organizational knowledge
• Real-time web search integration

🎯 Key Features:
• Videos → Detailed descriptions + full transcription + metadata
• Images → AI-powered visual analysis
• Audio → Complete transcription (perfect for call recordings)
• PDFs → Smart paragraph chunking for contextual retrieval

🔥 Why This Matters:
Unlike ChatGPT's limitations (10 PDF max), Singularity can:
• Handle unlimited documents
• Maintain perfect context across entire databases
• Provide precise, contextual responses
• Scale for enterprise-level deployments

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Frontend: React + TypeScript + Radix UI
• Backend: Express.js + n8n for workflows
• AI: Google Gemini + OpenAI + Pinecone Vector DB
• Real-time search: SerpAPI integration

Special thanks to @mohammad for the inspirational RAG workshop that sparked this idea!
